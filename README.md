# ML-Algorithms-Implementation

In this repo I have implemented all the machine learning algorithms in the various models. 

All the tasks have different scenarios whether for prediction or for classification and performance analysis.  

Downloaded all the datasets from kaggle.  

Also tested the performance of the model by giving inputs to this model according to the features that I have used to train the model.

Have tried to solve all the tasks given by the RM.
